Welcome to Flightsuit Systems! I'm Miles Muehlbach, and I've started this company to re-invent learning.
>I actually pitched this idea to a panel of judges at a competition, where I won $2,500 dollars in grant money to make this idea a reality!

I went about `55` minutes into the livestream!  
  
I'm excited to share updates as I continue working on this exciting project.  
  
Cheers,  
Miles!
